<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p> The anime of my life is One Piece. It's a story about Monkey D. Luffy, who wants to become the King of the Pirates. His story is really engaging, filled with numerous adventures and a plethora of cool characters. The story spans more than 100 volumes and has yet to reach its conclusion.</p>
<h3>Hunter x Hunter</h3>
<p> Another anime that I like is Hunter x Hunter the story is about Gon, who wants to find his father and understand the reason of his father leaving him alone.  </p>
